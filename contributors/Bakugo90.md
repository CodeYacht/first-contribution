I am a software engineer focus on Backend(server-side programming). I have a strong background in physics and a passion for problem-solving and programming.
My early exposure to algorithmic thinking in courses such as Pascal and Fortran at school led me to pursue the application of simulation techniques in physics to real-world problems using Python(NumPy).
I have the abilities to build complex systems such as web applications using django, Laravel and NodeJS.
I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others.
